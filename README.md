# RL_Resources
I found some interesting books and courses on Reinforcement Learning (RL) that I'd like to share here. If you're a student with an excellent math background and you love understanding machine learning algorithms from scratch, especially from a mathematical perspective (so you can really understand why something works, haha), I highly recommend exploring them! It's a great way to dive into new fields.
This is a Coursera course I liked: https://www.coursera.org/learn/unsupervised-learning-recommenders-reinforcement-learning . I can say it's a good introduction, but they fall short in explaining why things work; they mainly focus on how and when it works. For me, understanding why something works is really important so I can eventually improve it from scratch.
